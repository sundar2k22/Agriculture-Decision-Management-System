# GEOTA Project: Comparative Study of Yelahanka and Sarjapur

## Project Overview
This project, part of the **Geospatial Technologies and Applications (GEOTA)** course, presents a **comparative study** between two prominent regions of Bangalore:  
- **Yelahanka** (North Bangalore)  
- **Sarjapur** (South Bangalore)

The objective was to analyze and understand the spatial characteristics, development patterns, and geospatial trends of these two areas using modern GIS tools.

## Tools and Technologies
- **QGIS Software**
  - Digitization of geospatial data
  - Spatial analysis and calculations
  - Visualization and interpretation of datasets

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**  
   - Acquired satellite imagery and spatial datasets for Yelahanka and Sarjapur.

2. **Digitization**  
   - Created thematic layers in QGIS including:
     - Roads
     - Water bodies
     - Built-up areas
     - Vegetation cover

3. **Spatial Analysis**  
   - Conducted analyses such as:
     - Area calculations
     - Proximity analysis
     - Change detection

4. **Comparison and Conclusions**  
   - Performed a comparative study based on spatial parameters to highlight the differences and similarities between the two regions.
