# GEOTA Project: Comparative Study of Yelahanka and Sarjapur

## Project Overview
This project, part of the course on **Geospatial Technologies and Applications (GEOTA)**, presents a **comparative study** between two prominent regions of Bangalore:  
- **Yelahanka** (North Bangalore)  
- **Sarjapur** (South Bangalore)

The objective was to understand and analyze the spatial characteristics, development patterns, and geospatial trends between these two areas using modern GIS tools.

## Tools and Technologies
- **QGIS Software**  
  Extensively used for:
  - Digitizing geospatial data
  - Performing spatial analysis
  - Visualizing, interpreting, and drawing meaningful conclusions from the datasets

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**  
   Acquired satellite imagery and relevant spatial datasets for Yelahanka and Sarjapur.
   
2. **Digitization:**  
   Using QGIS, various thematic layers such as roads, water bodies, built-up areas, and vegetation cover were digitized for both regions.

3. **Spatial Analysis:**  
   Conducted multiple geospatial analyses including area calculations, proximity analysis, and change detection.

4. **Comparison and Conclusions:**  
   A comparative assessment was done based on several spatial parameters to highlight differences and similarities between the two study areas.

## Acknowledgements
